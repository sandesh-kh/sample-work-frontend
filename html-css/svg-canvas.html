Key Differences Between SVG and Canvas
Feature	        SVG	                                        Canvas
Graphics Type	Vector-based	                            Pixel-based
Resolution	    Resolution-independent	                    Resolution-dependent
Manipulation	DOM elements (easily styled and animated)	JavaScript (manual redraw required)
Performance	    Better for static or simple graphics	    Better for dynamic or real-time graphics
Interactivity	Built-in event handling (via DOM)	        Event handling needs to be coded
Use Cases	    Charts, logos, icons, illustrations	        Games, animations, custom graphics

When to Use SVG
If the graphics need to scale cleanly.
When interactivity is needed, like click or hover events.
For charts, diagrams, and UI components.
When to Use Canvas
When creating game-like animations.
For complex and dynamic visualizations.
If performance is a concern with thousands of objects.
