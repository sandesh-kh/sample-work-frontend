  <title>Optimized Asset Loading</title>

  <!--
    Technique 1: Minify CSS
    - Use minified CSS files to reduce file size and load faster.
    - Example: Using "styles.min.css" instead of "styles.css".
  -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.min.css">

  <!--
    Technique 2: Use Async/Defer for Scripts
    - Async: Loads the script while HTML parsing continues. Executes immediately after loading.
    - Defer: Loads the script while HTML parsing continues. Executes after HTML parsing is complete.
  -->
  <script src="analytics.js" async></script>
  <script src="main.js" defer></script>

  <!--
    Technique 3: Lazy Loading for Images
    - Use the "loading" attribute with "lazy" to defer loading images until they are in the viewport.
  -->
</head>

<body>
  <!--
    Technique 4: Use Optimized Image Formats
    - Use modern image formats like WebP for smaller file sizes and better quality.
  -->
  <img src="image.webp" alt="Optimized Image" loading="lazy">

  <!--
    Technique 5: Content Delivery Network (CDN)
    - Use a CDN to serve assets from locations closer to the user for faster load times.
  -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.example.com/library.min.css">

  <!--
    Technique 6: Combine CSS and JS
    - Combine multiple CSS or JS files into a single file to reduce HTTP requests.
    -->

  <!--
    Technique 7: Use Fonts Efficiently
    - Preload fonts to make them available early and reduce render-blocking issues.
  -->
  <link rel="preload" href="font.woff2" as="font" type="font/woff2" crossorigin="anonymous">

  <!-- Example Content -->
  <h1>Optimized Website Asset Loading</h1>
  <p>This webpage demonstrates techniques for optimizing asset loading.</p>

  <!--
    Technique 8: Gzip Compression
    - Enable gzip or Brotli compression on the server to reduce asset sizes.
    - This is configured server-side, not in the HTML file.
  -->

  <!--
    Technique 9: Cache Control
    - Set caching headers on the server to enable browser caching of static assets.
    -->

  <!-- Example Footer -->
  <footer>
    <p>Footer content here.</p>
  </footer>

  <!--
    Technique 10: Reduce Inline CSS/JS
    - Avoid excessive inline styles or scripts to keep the HTML clean.
  -->

    Key Optimization Techniques in the File:
Minify CSS and JS:
Use .min.css and .min.js files to reduce asset size.
Async/Defer for Scripts:
Use async for scripts that donâ€™t depend on others (e.g., analytics).
Use defer for scripts that need the DOM to be fully parsed first.
Lazy Loading Images:
Add loading="lazy" to <img> tags to delay loading images until they are needed.
Modern Image Formats:
Use formats like WebP, AVIF for images to reduce file size.
Content Delivery Network (CDN):
Serve assets like CSS, JS, and images via a CDN for faster loading.
Preload Fonts:
Use <link rel="preload"> to load fonts early without blocking rendering.
Combine Files:
Merge CSS and JS files to minimize HTTP requests.
Compression (Server-side):
Enable gzip or Brotli compression on the server to reduce file sizes.
Cache Control (Server-side):
Use caching headers to enable long-term caching of static assets.
Reduce Inline CSS/JS:
Externalize styles and scripts to keep HTML lean.

Benefits of These Optimizations:
Faster Loading Times: Reduced asset size and optimized loading strategies speed up rendering.
Improved SEO: Better performance can improve search rankings.
Enhanced User Experience: Faster websites retain more users and reduce bounce rates.
Bandwidth Savings: Smaller assets mean less data is transferred, saving bandwidth.
