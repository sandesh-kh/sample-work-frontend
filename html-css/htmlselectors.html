    Differences Between class and id:
Purpose:
class: Used to group multiple elements together that share the same style. A single element can have multiple classes.
id: Used to uniquely identify a single element on the page. An id should be unique within the document, meaning no two elements should have the same id.

Usage:
class: Can be applied to multiple elements (e.g., several paragraphs, divs, etc.), and you can use the same class on multiple elements.
id: Can only be applied to a single element per page, as each id must be unique.

CSS Selector Specificity:
class: Has a lower specificity than id. It is selected using a period (.) in CSS.
id: Has a higher specificity than class. It is selected using a hash (#) in CSS.
H
TML Example:
class: Multiple elements can have the same class.
id: Only one element can have a specific id.

Summary of Selectors:
Class (.): Targets elements with a specific class. Can be used on multiple elements.
ID (#): Targets a single element with a specific id.
Element (e.g., p, div): Targets all elements of that type.
Universal (*): Targets all elements.
Attribute ([attr=value]): Targets elements based on an attribute.
Descendant (space): Targets nested elements.
Child (>): Targets direct children.
Pseudo-classes (:): Targets elements in a specific state.
Pseudo-elements (::): Targets part of an element.
