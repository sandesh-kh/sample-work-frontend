Key Differences Between Adaptive and Responsive Design

Feature	            Responsive Design	                                            Adaptive Design
Layout Flexibility	Fluid layout, adjusts automatically to screen size.	            Fixed layouts based on device or screen size.
Codebase	        Single codebase (one layout for all devices).	                Multiple layouts for different screen sizes or devices.
Device Detection	Relies on media queries to adjust layout.	                    Relies on detecting the device or screen size (via JavaScript or CSS).
User Experience	    Seamless experience with real-time layout changes.	            More control over design but less fluid than responsive.
Maintenance	        Easier to maintain (one layout for all devices).	            More complex, as it requires multiple layouts for different devices.
SEO	                SEO-friendly (single URL for all devices).	                    Can lead to SEO challenges (different URLs for different devices).
Performance	        Can be less optimized for large screens, loads all resources.	Optimized for each device but may require device detection scripts.
