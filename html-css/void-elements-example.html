  <title>Void Elements Example</title>

<body>
  <!--
    Explanation:
    Void elements are tags that do not require a closing tag. They are self-contained and typically used for elements that do not have content between an opening and closing tag. 
    Examples: <img>, <br>, <hr>, <input>, <meta>, <link>, etc.
  -->

  <!-- Example of an image element (void element) -->
  <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="Placeholder Image" />
  <!--
    <img> is a void element.
    It is used to embed images in a webpage.
    The 'src' attribute specifies the image source, and the 'alt' attribute provides alternative text for the image.
    It doesn't require a closing tag.
  -->

  <!-- Example of a line break (void element) -->
  <p>This is some text before the break.</p>
  <br />
  <p>This is some text after the break.</p>
  <!--
    <br> is a void element.
    It is used to create a line break, moving the content after it to a new line.
    No closing tag is required.
  -->

  <!-- Example of a horizontal rule (void element) -->
  <hr />
  <!--
    <hr> is a void element.
    It creates a horizontal line (rule) across the page, typically used to separate sections of content.
    It does not need a closing tag.

  <!-- Example of an input field (void element) -->
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" />
  <!--
    <input> is a void element.
    It is used to create form fields, such as text boxes, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.
    The 'type' attribute defines the input type (e.g., text, password, etc.).
    The <input> element does not need a closing tag.
  -->

  <!-- Example of a meta tag (void element) -->
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <!--
    <meta> is a void element.
    It provides metadata about the document, such as character encoding or author information.
    It is typically used in the <head> section and does not require a closing tag.
  -->

  <!-- Example of a link tag (void element) -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
  <!--
    <link> is a void element.
    It is used to link external resources, like stylesheets, to the document.
    The 'rel' attribute defines the relationship (e.g., stylesheet), and 'href' specifies the location of the resource.
    No closing tag is required.
